/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please reading the following instruction before you want to customize CSS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

!!!! Strongly suggest you that don't edit the orignal CSS files in the theme folder, 
otherwise, you won't upgrade the theme conveniently.

The recommended customize method is copy the orignal CSS from the following files to custom.css, 
then just change it to what you want, or you can also add your custom CSS into "MagicBook Options > Custom Style > Custom CSS".
Of course, create a child theme is the best solution.
